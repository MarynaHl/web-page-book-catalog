This project demonstrates how to design and implement a simple **RESTful API** and a connected **frontend** web page.

It consists of:
- **Frontend:** a semantic, responsive HTML/CSS/JS application for browsing books.  
- **Backend (API):** a REST API built with **Express.js**, providing access to book data.
